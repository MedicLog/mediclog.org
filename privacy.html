        <section class="legal-section">
            <h2>Our Privacy Approach</h2>
            <p>MedicLog is built on a simple principle: <strong>your data belongs to you</strong>. We designed the app so that we never receive, store, or have access to your patient care data or personal information.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>The short version:</strong> MedicLog collects no personal data, requires no account, and stores everything locally on your device. We cannot see your data because it never leaves your device unless you explicitly share it.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="legal-section">
            <h2>What Data MedicLog Stores</h2>
            <p>MedicLog stores the following data <strong>locally on your device only</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Patient care records you create (vitals, medications, procedures, timestamps)</li>
                <li>Your custom settings and preferences</li>
                <li>Voice recognition training data for custom aliases</li>
                <li>Archived call history</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This data is stored in your device's secure app container and is included in your standard iOS backup (iCloud or iTunes).</p>
        </section>

        <section class="legal-section">
            <h2>What We Do NOT Collect</h2>
            <p>MedicLog does not collect, transmit, or have access to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Patient information or protected health information (PHI)</li>
                <li>Your name, email, phone number, or any personal identifiers</li>
                <li>Location data or GPS coordinates</li>
                <li>Voice recordings (speech is processed on-device and discarded)</li>
                <li>Usage analytics or behavioral data</li>
                <li>Device identifiers or advertising IDs</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We have no servers that receive your data. We cannot access your information because we never receive it.</p>

            <h2>Data Sharing Features</h2>
            <p>When you use MedicLog's sharing features:</p>

            <h3>QR Code Sharing</h3>
            <p>Sharing a call via QR code transfers data directly between devices using end-to-end encryption. The receiving device decrypts the data locally. If devices cannot connect directly (via local network or Bluetooth), data may pass through an encrypted relay, but the relay cannot read the contents—only the recipient's device can decrypt it.</p>

            <h3>PDF/JSON Export</h3>
            <p>When you export a call as PDF or JSON, the file is created locally on your device. What you do with that file (email, AirDrop, save to files) is under your control and subject to the privacy practices of those services.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="legal-section">
            <h2>HIPAA Considerations</h2>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> MedicLog is a documentation tool used on your personal or agency-issued device. We are not a Business Associate under HIPAA because we never receive, store, or process protected health information (PHI).</p>
            </div>

            <p>Here's what this means for you:</p>

            <h3>Your Responsibilities</h3>
            <p>As an EMS professional, you are responsible for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Securing your device with a passcode, Face ID, or Touch ID</li>
                <li>Following your agency's policies for mobile device use</li>
                <li>Ensuring shared data reaches only intended recipients</li>
                <li>Properly disposing of exported files containing PHI</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How MedicLog Helps</h3>
            <p>MedicLog supports your HIPAA compliance by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Storing data only in iOS's secure app container (encrypted at rest)</li>
                <li>Using end-to-end encryption for all data sharing</li>
                <li>Requiring no cloud storage or account creation</li>
                <li>Keeping all voice processing on-device</li>
                <li>Never transmitting data without your explicit action</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>We Are Not a Business Associate</h3>
            <p>Because MedicLog's architecture ensures we never receive or have access to PHI, we do not meet the HIPAA definition of a Business Associate. There is no data for us to protect because we never have it. Your data exists only on your device and any devices you explicitly share it with.</p>

        <section class="legal-section">
            <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>MedicLog uses the following device capabilities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Apple Speech Recognition:</strong> Processed entirely on-device. Voice data is not sent to Apple or any server.</li>
                <li><strong>Apple Watch Connectivity:</strong> Data syncs between your devices via Apple's encrypted protocols.</li>
                <li><strong>iCloud Backup:</strong> If enabled, your MedicLog data is included in your iOS backup, subject to Apple's privacy policy.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We do not use any analytics services, advertising networks, or crash reporting tools that would transmit your data.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="legal-section">
            <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
            <p>You control your data retention:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Delete individual calls at any time from within the app</li>
                <li>All data is removed when you delete the app</li>
                <li>iCloud backups retain data according to your iCloud settings</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Since we never receive your data, there is nothing for us to delete on our end.</p>

            <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>MedicLog is designed for EMS professionals and is not intended for use by children under 17. We do not knowingly collect any information from children.</p>
