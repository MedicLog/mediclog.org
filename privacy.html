        <section class="legal-section">
            <h2>Our Privacy Approach</h2>
            <p>MedicLog is built on a simple principle: <strong>your data belongs to you</strong>. We designed the app so that we never receive, store, or have access to your patient care data or personal information.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>The short version:</strong> MedicLog collects no personal data, requires no account, and stores everything locally on your device. We cannot see your data because it never leaves your device unless you explicitly share it.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="legal-section">
            <h2>What Data MedicLog Stores</h2>
            <p>MedicLog stores the following data <strong>locally on your device only</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Patient care records you create (vitals, medications, procedures, timestamps)</li>
                <li>Patient identifying information if configured (name, date of birth)</li>
                <li>Your custom settings and preferences</li>
                <li>Voice recognition training data for custom aliases</li>
                <li>Archived call history</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This data is stored in your device's secure app container and is included in your standard iOS backup (iCloud or iTunes).</p>
        </section>

        <section class="legal-section">
            <h2>What We Do NOT Collect</h2>
            <p>MedicLog does not collect, transmit, or have access to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your name, email, phone number, or any personal identifiers</li>
                <li>Voice recordings (speech is processed on-device and discarded)</li>
                <li>Usage analytics or behavioral data</li>
                <li>Device identifiers or advertising IDs</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We have no servers that receive your data. We cannot access your information because we never receive it.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="legal-section">
            <h2>Location Data</h2>
            <p>MedicLog uses your device's GPS for the following features:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Closest Hospital:</strong> When you tap "Find Hospital," MedicLog uses your current location to show nearby hospitals sorted by distance</li>
                <li><strong>Navigation:</strong> When you select a hospital, MedicLog passes the address to your chosen mapping app (Apple Maps or Google Maps) for turn-by-turn directions</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Location data is used transiently for these features and is not stored or transmitted to our servers. The mapping application you choose handles navigation according to their own privacy policy.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="legal-section">
            <h2>Data Sharing Features</h2>
            <p>When you use MedicLog's sharing features:</p>

            <h3>QR Code Sharing</h3>
            <p>Sharing a call via QR code transfers data directly between devices using end-to-end encryption. The receiving device decrypts the data locally. If devices cannot connect directly (via local network or Bluetooth), data may pass through an encrypted relay, but the relay cannot read the contents—only the recipient's device can decrypt it.</p>

            <h3>PDF/JSON Export</h3>
            <p>When you export a call as PDF or JSON, the file is created locally on your device. What you do with that file (email, AirDrop, save to files) is under your control and subject to the privacy practices of those services.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="legal-section">
            <h2>Patient Data & HIPAA Compliance</h2>

            <p>MedicLog is designed to handle patient data responsibly while maintaining HIPAA compliance:</p>

            <h3>How MedicLog Protects PHI</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Encryption at Rest:</strong> All patient data is stored in iOS's secure app container, encrypted by the operating system</li>
                <li><strong>Encryption in Transit:</strong> When sharing data via QR code, end-to-end encryption ensures only the intended recipient can decrypt the information</li>
                <li><strong>No Cloud Storage:</strong> Patient data never leaves your device unless you explicitly share or export it</li>
                <li><strong>On-Device Processing:</strong> Voice recognition and all data processing happens locally on your device</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Your Responsibilities</h3>
            <p>As an EMS professional, you are responsible for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Securing your device with a passcode, Face ID, or Touch ID</li>
                <li>Following your agency's policies for mobile device use</li>
                <li>Ensuring shared data reaches only intended recipients</li>
                <li>Properly disposing of exported files containing PHI</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Data Architecture</h3>
            <p>MedicLog's architecture ensures we never receive or have access to your patient data. Your PHI exists only on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your device (encrypted in the app's secure container)</li>
                <li>Devices you explicitly share data with (via encrypted transfer)</li>
                <li>Files you export (under your control)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We have no servers that store patient data. The only data we receive is optional support logs (which never contain patient information) that you explicitly submit.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="legal-section">
            <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>MedicLog uses the following device capabilities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Apple Speech Recognition:</strong> Processed entirely on-device. Voice data is not sent to Apple or any server.</li>
                <li><strong>Apple Watch Connectivity:</strong> Data syncs between your devices via Apple's encrypted protocols.</li>
                <li><strong>iCloud Backup:</strong> If enabled, your MedicLog data is included in your iOS backup, subject to Apple's privacy policy.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We do not use any analytics services, advertising networks, or crash reporting tools that would transmit your data.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="legal-section">
            <h2>Support Logging (Opt-In)</h2>
            <p>MedicLog includes an optional support logging feature that you can enable to help us diagnose issues:</p>

            <h3>What Support Logging Does</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>When Enabled:</strong> Technical diagnostic data (button taps, screen navigation, timer states, error messages) is logged locally on your device</li>
                <li><strong>What Is NOT Logged:</strong> Patient data, medications, vitals, or any clinical information is never included in support logs</li>
                <li><strong>Submission:</strong> Logs are only sent to us when you explicitly tap "Submit" in Settings → Support</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Where Logs Go</h3>
            <p>When you submit support logs, they are sent to our GitHub repository's issue tracker as a private diagnostic file. This includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>App version and device model</li>
                <li>Technical interaction logs (no patient data)</li>
                <li>Error messages and crash context</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> Support logging is disabled by default. You must explicitly enable it in Settings, and logs are only transmitted when you manually submit them. A persistent banner appears on screen while logging is active.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="legal-section">
            <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
            <p>You control your data retention:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Delete individual calls at any time from within the app</li>
                <li>All data is removed when you delete the app</li>
                <li>iCloud backups retain data according to your iCloud settings</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Since we never receive your data, there is nothing for us to delete on our end.</p>
