                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Yes, MedicLog is designed to work completely offline. All features including voice recognition run entirely on your device. You never need an internet connection to log calls, use timers, or access your data. The app was built specifically for EMS environments where cellular coverage is unreliable.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>The beta is completely free—no in-app purchases, subscriptions, or ads. Pricing after full release hasn't been decided yet, but I work in EMS so I know what we all make. It'll be affordable.</p>

                    <p>No. MedicLog requires no account, no login, and no personal information. Just download and start using it. This is intentional—we believe your patient care data should stay on your device, not on our servers.</p>

                    <p>MedicLog is designed with privacy as a core principle. Because we never receive, store, or have access to your patient data, there is no covered data for us to protect. Your data stays entirely on your device. See our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy page</a> for complete details on our approach to data handling and HIPAA considerations.</p>

                    <p>MedicLog data is included in your standard iPhone/iPad backup (iCloud or local iTunes backup). You can also export individual calls as PDF or JSON files to save to your preferred location. We recommend enabling iCloud backup for automatic protection.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Deleting the app removes all local data from your device. If you have an iCloud backup, you can restore your data by reinstalling the app and restoring from backup. We recommend exporting important calls before deleting the app.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>No. Voice recognition runs entirely on-device using Apple's on-device speech recognition. This means it works without any internet connection, and your voice data never leaves your device. It's optimized for noisy ambulance environments.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Yes! MedicLog supports iOS Shortcuts for automation. You can set up triggers like "start a new call when I receive a dispatch SMS" or use NFC tags for quick status updates. See our <a href="shortcuts.html">Shortcuts guide</a> for step-by-step setup instructions.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Multiple options: <strong>AirDrop</strong> is fastest (tap Share → AirDrop, select their device). <strong>QR Code</strong> works for smaller calls — your partner scans the code with MedicLog. For larger calls, use AirDrop or <strong>Email/SMS</strong> with an encrypted file and separate decryption code. All methods use end-to-end encryption and work without internet.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>QR codes can hold about 3 KB of data. If your call has many entries, vitals, or photos, it exceeds this limit and QR is disabled. Use AirDrop instead — MedicLog will automatically encrypt the file and show a QR code with just the encryption key for your partner to scan.</p>

                    <p>Go to <strong>Settings → Voice Aliases</strong>, tap "Train New Alias", then record yourself saying the word 3 times. MedicLog extracts the speech variants it hears and lets you pick which ones to save. Map them to a medication and you're done. Your custom aliases override the built-in ones.</p>

                    <p>The Watch app syncs with your iPhone but can function independently for quick entries and timer viewing.

                <button class="faq-question" onclick="this.parentElement.classList.toggle('open')">
                    What's the difference between AirDrop, QR Code, and Photo Handoff?
                </button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p><strong>AirDrop:</strong> Fastest method if both people have iPhones nearby. Instant, encrypted transfer via Bluetooth. No internet needed, no scanning required.</p>
                    <p><strong>QR Code:</strong> Good when you're in different locations or don't have immediate proximity. Your partner scans the code with their phone. Works over WiFi or Bluetooth. Your partner's phone must have MedicLog installed.</p>
                    <p><strong>Photo Handoff:</strong> Works with any phone or tablet, even without MedicLog installed. Perfect at hospital handoff - display it on your screen and let the receiving RN photograph it for their records.</p>
                    <p><strong>Email/SMS:</strong> Use when you need a record that can be forwarded or when asynchronous transfer is needed. Encryption code is sent separately for security.</p>

                </button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>All sharing methods use end-to-end encryption. When you generate a QR code or AirDrop a call, the data is encrypted before leaving your device. It never travels to our servers unencrypted.</p>
                    <p>Each QR code is uniquely encrypted - the encryption changes every time you generate a code. Your partner scans it and their device decrypts it locally on their phone.</p>
                    <p>For Email/SMS sharing, the call data is encrypted and sent separately from the decryption code, so neither piece alone is useful without both.</p>

                    <p>Create separate profiles in Settings for different roles (Paramedic, EMT-Basic, Critical Care, etc.). Each profile has its own name and certification level.</p>
                    <p><strong>Profile-specific settings:</strong> Your name, unit assignment, which medications are enabled in your formulary, and personal documentation preferences.</p>
                    <p><strong>Shared across profiles:</strong> Your agency's destination list, any custom medications you've created, and global display preferences (colors, layouts, timer settings).</p>
                    <p>To switch profiles, tap the profile name at the top of the screen when starting a call. The change takes effect immediately for the next call.</p>

                    <p><strong>Set Defaults:</strong> Define standard doses and routes for each medication. When you select a med, it pre-fills with your defaults.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p><strong>Redose:</strong> Log another dose of the same medication with the same dose/route. Fresh timer starts immediately.</p>
                    <p><strong>Snooze:</strong> Extend the timer by 1 minute. Use this when you're not ready to redose yet but don't want the overdue alert.</p>
                    <p><strong>Withheld:</strong> Document that you chose NOT to give the medication at the redose time. This creates a log entry showing the decision and reason (medical decision, patient refused, etc.).</p>
                    <p><strong>Delete:</strong> Remove the timer entirely. Use this if you logged a medication in error.</p>

                    <p>When multiple timers expire, MedicLog groups the oldest expired timers into a compact badge (e.g., "OVER...×3") to keep your active and newest expired timers visible. Tap the badge to expand and see all expired timers individually. It auto-collapses after a few seconds.</p>

                    Can I transfer my profile and settings to a new device or share with a crew member?

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Yes. Go to <strong>Settings → Profile → Export</strong> to create a .mlconfig file containing your profile, display preferences, dispatch templates, voice aliases, and destinations. Share it via AirDrop or email. When imported on another device, it creates a new profile without overwriting anything. Note: call history and medication formulary are not included in the export.</p>

                    How do I use Hospital Handoff? What should I show the receiving nurse?
                </button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Tap the <strong>Hospital Handoff</strong> button on any completed call. This generates a structured report of your entire call: initial assessment, medications with timestamps, vital signs progression, procedures, and special notes.</p>
                    <p>Use <strong>Photo Handoff mode</strong> to display it on your screen - let the receiving RN photograph it with their phone or tablet for their records. This works even if their hospital ePCR system is down.</p>
                    <p>Or export as PDF to email to the hospital, print, or attach to your agency's records.</p>
                    <p>The handoff report shows the complete timeline in a format nurses expect - they can quickly understand your assessment, interventions, and patient response.</p>
