                    <p>MedicLog parses your speech into structured entries. It recognizes:</p>
                    <ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem; padding-left: 1.5rem;">
                        <li><strong>Medications:</strong> "Fentanyl 50 mcg IV" — extracts drug name, dose, unit, and route</li>
                        <li><strong>Vitals:</strong> "BP 120 over 80, heart rate 88, spo2 98"</li>
                        <li><strong>Procedures:</strong> "IV placed 18 gauge" or "intubated" or "12 lead obtained"</li>
                        <li><strong>Cardiac:</strong> "Started CPR" or "Shock delivered 200 joules" or "ROSC achieved"</li>
                        <li><strong>Corrections:</strong> Say "Correction..." to modify a previous entry</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The app shows you what it heard before logging. If recognition isn't perfect, edit it in the confirmation screen.</p>
                    <p>For best results, speak clearly and say dose units explicitly ("fifty mike" or "fifty micrograms" instead of just "fifty").</p>

                <div class="feature-description">
                    <h3>Custom Voice Aliases</h3>
                    <p>Every medication comes with built-in speech aliases (e.g., "epi", "epinephrine", and "adrenaline" all match Epinephrine). Common phonetic mishears are pre-loaded too ("nar can" for Narcan, "so fran" for Zofran).</p>
                    <p><strong>Train your own aliases:</strong> In Settings, tap a medication and record yourself saying the word 3 times. MedicLog extracts the speech variants and saves them. Your custom aliases override the built-in ones.</p>
                    <p><strong>On Apple Watch:</strong> Raise your wrist to auto-launch dictation. Quick suggestion buttons appear for common entries like "Vitals taken", "IV started", "CPR started" — just tap or speak.</p>

                    <p><strong>QR Code:</strong> Generate a code and have your partner scan it. Works with or without cellular signal. Can also work as a backup encryption method if you don't want to share via Bluetooth.</p>
                    <p><strong>Email/SMS:</strong> Send the call encrypted, with the decryption code sent as a separate message for security.</p>
                    <p><strong>Photo Handoff:</strong> Display the call summary on your phone for the receiving nurse to photograph with theirs (useful at hospital handoff).</p>
                    <p><strong>Redact Patient Info:</strong> Toggle to replace names, DOB, age, and sex with [REDACTED] before sharing - keeps the clinical record while protecting privacy.</p>

                    <h3>QR Code Sharing Details</h3>
                    <p><strong>Small calls (under ~3 KB):</strong> The entire call fits in a single QR code. Your partner scans it and gets the data instantly - no extra steps needed.</p>
                    <p><strong>Larger calls:</strong> The QR code option is disabled (greyed out) when the call data exceeds what a QR code can hold. Use AirDrop instead - MedicLog encrypts the file automatically and shows you a separate QR code with the encryption key for your partner to scan.</p>
                    <p><strong>Email/SMS sharing:</strong> The call is encrypted with a random 6-digit code. Send the file one way (email) and the code another way (text message) so neither is useful alone.</p>
                    <p>QR codes use the highest error correction level (30% recovery) so they scan reliably even at angles, in poor lighting, or through dirty screens.</p>

                    <h3>Scanning &amp; Receiving</h3>
                    <p>To receive a call via QR, open MedicLog and tap <strong>Scan QR Code</strong> from the Share menu. Point your camera at the sender's screen.</p>
                    <p>MedicLog recognizes what type of QR it's scanning automatically: call data, encryption keys, contact info, or configuration settings.</p>
                    <p>For encrypted files received via email, enter the 6-digit code the sender texted you. MedicLog auto-fills the code if it detects a matching SMS on your device.</p>
                    <p>All encryption uses AES-256-GCM (the same standard used by banks and governments). Your data never passes through any server.</p>

                    <h3>When to Use Each Method</h3>
                    <p><strong>AirDrop</strong> — Your partner is right here with an iPhone. Fastest and most secure. Recommended for crew-to-crew transfers.</p>
                    <p><strong>QR Code</strong> — Small call, quick one-scan transfer. Disabled for larger calls that won't fit.</p>
                    <p><strong>Email/SMS</strong> — Your partner isn't nearby, or you're transferring to someone on a different platform. Encrypted file sent separately from the decryption code.</p>
                    <p><strong>Photo Handoff</strong> — At the hospital, the RN needs a quick record. Works with any phone, no app needed on their end.</p>
                    <p><strong>PDF Export</strong> — For printing, attaching to hospital records, or emailing to your agency. Choose Detailed for complete documentation or Summary for a quick MIST handoff report.</p>

                    <h3>Patient Information Protection</h3>
                    <p>MedicLog detects when a call contains patient-identifiable information (name, DOB, etc.) and shows smart warnings before sharing.</p>
                    <p><strong>No nagging:</strong> If your call has no patient info, or you're using a secure method like AirDrop, you won't see any warnings. They only appear when needed.</p>
                    <p><strong>Redact toggle:</strong> When exporting for records, flip the "Redact patient info" switch to replace names and DOB with [REDACTED]. This resets to ON each session so you never accidentally export unredacted data.</p>
                    <p>Every export includes a reminder that you're responsible for HIPAA compliance with the exported data.</p>

                    <p>The report is organized for bedside reference, not as a minute-by-minute timeline. Sections include:</p>

                    <p>Screen brightness automatically maximizes. Content is organized with clear section dividers (Vitals, Medications, Procedures, Notes). Vitals taken within 2 minutes are grouped on one line.</p>
                    <p>Use the large chevron buttons (sized for gloved hands) to page through the report. Text snaps to line boundaries so nothing gets cut off mid-line. Controls auto-hide after 3 seconds for clean screenshots.</p>
                    <p><strong>Why Photo Handoff?</strong> It works with any phone, any ePCR system, no app required on the receiving end. When the hospital's computers are busy or down, this is the most reliable way to get your documentation to the receiving nurse.</p>

                    <p><strong>Enable/Disable:</strong> Turn off medications you don't carry (e.g., paramedic-only drugs if you're an EMT). Only enabled meds appear in quick entry.</p>
                    <p><strong>Add Custom Medications:</strong> Add agency-specific medications, off-protocol drugs you might use, or documentation-only entries (like "Protocol Violation Documented").</p>
                    <p><strong>Set Default Doses & Routes:</strong> Define standard doses and routes for each medication. When you select a med, it pre-fills with your defaults - faster entry.</p>
                    <p><strong>Organize by Category:</strong> Reorder categories or create custom groupings to match your mental model of your formulary.</p>
                    <p><strong>Configure Timer Intervals:</strong> Set how long timers run for each medication (redose windows, regulatory intervals, etc.). Choose a timer color from 8 presets or pick a custom color so you can tell medications apart at a glance.</p>

                    <p><strong>Quick switch:</strong> When starting a call, tap the profile name at the top to change who's logging. Profiles switch instantly.</p>
                    <p><strong>What carries across profiles:</strong> Your agency's destination list, shared custom medications, and global preferences (timer colors, display settings).</p>
                    <p><strong>What's profile-specific:</strong> Your name, unit assignment, which meds are enabled, and your personal documentation preferences.</p>
                    <p><strong>Export/Import:</strong> Export your profile as a .mlconfig file to share with crew members or transfer to a new device. Importing creates a new profile — it never overwrites your existing data.</p>
