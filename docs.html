                    <p>Tap <strong>Voice Log</strong> and speak naturally: "Adenosine 12 mg IV push" - MedicLog parses medication, dose, and route automatically.</p>
                    <p>Works completely offline using on-device speech recognition. No internet required.</p>

                    <h3>How Voice Recognition Works</h3>
                    <p>MedicLog listens for medication names, doses, and routes. Say the medication, amount, and how you're giving it: <strong>"Narcan 2 mg intranasal" or "Epi 0.3 point 3 IV push"</strong>.</p>
                    <p>The app shows you what it heard before logging. If recognition isn't perfect, edit it in the confirmation screen - your edits teach the app.</p>
                    <p>For best results, speak clearly and avoid background noise when possible (though it's designed to work in ambulances).</p>
                    <p>What gets transcribed: medication, dose, route, and timing. Patient information, vital signs, and clinical notes stay in typed entries.</p>

                    <p><strong>QR Code:</strong> Generate a code and have your partner scan it. Works with or without cellular signal. Can also work as a backup encryption method if you don't want to share via Bluetooth.</p>
                    <p><strong>Email/SMS:</strong> Send the call encrypted, with the decryption code sent as a separate message for security.</p>
                    <p><strong>Photo Handoff:</strong> Display the call summary on your phone for the receiving nurse to photograph with theirs (useful at hospital handoff).</p>
                    <p><strong>Redact Patient Info:</strong> Toggle to replace names, DOB, age, and sex with [REDACTED] before sharing - keeps the clinical record while protecting privacy.</p>

                    <p>QR codes are fairly large on screen (so your partner can scan from several feet away), and the encryption changes every time you generate a code.</p>
                    <p>Your partner's phone must have MedicLog installed. If they don't yet, use AirDrop, Email, or Photo Handoff instead.</p>

                    <h3>Display Mode for Photography</h3>
                    <p>Select <strong>Photo Handoff</strong> from the Share menu. Your iPhone displays the complete call summary in a large, readable format.</p>
                    <p>The screen stays on and shows high-contrast, easy-to-read details. Let the receiving nurse photograph it with their phone or tablet for their records.</p>
                    <p>This works even when the hospital's computer systems are busy or down - it's a simple, reliable backup method.</p>
                    <p>Compared to QR codes (requires scanning and app), or AirDrop (requires shared devices) - Photo Handoff works with any phone and any ePCR system.</p>

                    <h3>Customize Your Medications</h3>
                    <p>Go to <strong>Settings → Formulary Management</strong> to control which medications appear in your picker.</p>
                    <p><strong>Enable/Disable:</strong> Turn off medications you don't carry (e.g., paramedic-only drugs if you're an EMT). Only enabled meds appear in quick entry.</p>
                    <p><strong>Add Custom Medications:</strong> Add agency-specific medications, off-protocol drugs you might use, or documentation-only entries (like "Protocol Violation Documented").</p>
                    <p><strong>Set Default Doses & Routes:</strong> Define standard doses and routes for each medication. When you select a med, it pre-fills with your defaults - faster entry.</p>
                    <p><strong>Organize by Category:</strong> Reorder categories or create custom groupings to match your mental model of your formulary.</p>
                    <p><strong>Configure Timer Intervals:</strong> Set how long timers run for each medication (redose windows, regulatory intervals, etc.).</p>

                    <h3>Multiple Profiles</h3>
                    <p><strong>Create profiles</strong> in Settings for different roles: Paramedic, EMT-Basic, Critical Care, Supervisor, or custom titles.</p>
                    <p>Each profile remembers: your name, certification level, agency/unit, default destination, and custom formulary settings.</p>
                    <p><strong>Quick switch:</strong> When starting a call, tap the profile name at the top to change who's logging. Profiles switch instantly.</p>
                    <p><strong>What carries across profiles:</strong> Your agency's destination list, shared custom medications, and global preferences (timer colors, display settings).</p>
                    <p><strong>What's profile-specific:</strong> Your name, unit assignment, which meds are enabled, and your personal documentation preferences.</p>
                    <p>Perfect for medics who work multiple roles, or crews where multiple people use the same iPad.</p>

                    <p><strong>Signs:</strong> Initial vital signs and any changes during transport. MedicLog shows initial vs current for easy comparison.</p>
                    <p><strong>Treatment:</strong> Interventions performed with timestamps - medications, procedures, oxygen, fluids, etc.</p>
                    <p>Perfect for radio traffic to medical control or for structured hospital handoff. See our <a href="transfer.html">Transfer Workflow</a> documentation for detailed handoff strategies.</p>
